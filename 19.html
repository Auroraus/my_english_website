The Past Five Years: Our Work and Historic Change</strong></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">十八大以来的五年，是党和国家发展进程中极不平凡的五年。面对世界经济复苏乏力、局部冲突和动荡频发、全球性问题加剧的外部环境，面对我国经济发展进入新常态等一系列深刻变化，我们坚持稳中求进工作总基调，迎难而上，开拓进取，取得了改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的历史性成就。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">The five years since the 18th National Congress have been a truly remarkable five years in the course of the development of the Party and the country. Outside China, we have been confronted with sluggish global economic recovery, frequent outbreaks of regional conflicts and disturbances, and intensifying global issues. At home, we have encountered profound changes as China has entered a new normal in economic development. We have upheld the underlying principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, risen to challenges, pioneered and pushed ahead, and made historic achievements in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">为贯彻十八大精神，党中央召开七次全会，分别就政府机构改革和职能转变、全面深化改革、全面推进依法治国、制定“十三五”规划、全面从严治党等重大问题作出决定和部署。五年来，我们统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局、协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，“十二五”规划胜利完成，“十三五”规划顺利实施，党和国家事业全面开创新局面。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">To put the guiding principles from our 18th National Congress into action, the Party Central Committee has held seven plenary sessions. There, decisions and plans were made on issues of major importance, from reforming the institutions and transforming the functions of government to deepening reform in all areas, advancing law-based governance, formulating the 13th Five-Year Plan, and seeing governance over the Party is exercised fully and with rigor. In the past five years, we have implemented the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, fulfilled the goals of the 12th Five-Year Plan, and made smooth progress in implementing the 13th Five-Year Plan. On all fronts new advances have been made for the cause of the Party and the country.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">经济建设取得重大成就。坚定不移贯彻新发展理念，坚决端正发展观念、转变发展方式，发展质量和效益不断提升。经济保持中高速增长，在世界主要国家中名列前茅，国内生产总值从五十四万亿元增长到八十万亿元，稳居世界第二，对世界经济增长贡献率超过百分之三十。供给侧结构性改革深入推进，经济结构不断优化，数字经济等新兴产业蓬勃发展，高铁、公路、桥梁、港口、机场等基础设施建设快速推进。农业现代化稳步推进，粮食生产能力达到一万二千亿斤。城镇化率年均提高一点二个百分点，八千多万农业转移人口成为城镇居民。区域发展协调性增强，“一带一路”建设、京津冀协同发展、长江经济带发展成效显著。创新驱动发展战略大力实施，创新型国家建设成果丰硕，天宫、蛟龙、天眼、悟空、墨子、大飞机等重大科技成果相继问世。南海岛礁建设积极推进。开放型经济新体制逐步健全，对外贸易、对外投资、外汇储备稳居世界前列。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">* We have made major achievements in economic development.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We have remained committed to the new development philosophy, adopted the right approach to development, and endeavored to transform the growth model. The result has been a constant improvement in the quality and effect of development. The economy has maintained a medium-high growth rate, making China a leader among the major economies. With the gross domestic product rising from 54 trillion to 80 trillion yuan, China has maintained its position as the world&#39;s second largest economy and contributed more than 30 percent of global economic growth.

Emerging industries like the digital economy are thriving; the construction of high-speed railways, highways, bridges, ports, airports, and other types of infrastructure has picked up pace.

Regional development has become more balanced; the Belt and Road Initiative, the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt have all made notable progress. Through devoting great energy to implementing the innovation-driven development strategy, we have seen much accomplished toward making China a country of innovators, with major advances made in science and technology, including the successful launch of Tiangong-2 space lab, the commissioning of the deep-sea manned submersible Jiaolong and of the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical telescope (FAST) Tianyan, the launch of the dark matter probe satellite Wukong and the quantum science satellite Mozi, and the test flight of the airliner C919.

The importance of Marxism as a guiding ideology is better appreciated. Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Chinese Dream have been embraced by our people. Core socialist values and fine traditional Chinese culture are alive in the people&#39;s hearts. Initiatives to improve public etiquette and ethical standards have proved successful. Public cultural services have been improved; art and literature are thriving, and cultural programs and industries are going strong. The development, administration, and functioning of internet services have been enhanced. Fitness-for-All programs and competitive sports have seen extensive development. Our country&#39;s underlying values hold greater appeal than ever before, and the wave of positive energy felt throughout society is building.

As a result, the entire Party and the whole country have become more purposeful and active in pursuing green development, and there has been a clear shift away from the tendency to neglect ecological and environmental protection. Efforts to develop a system for building an ecological civilization have been accelerated; the system of functional zoning has been steadily improved; and progress has been made in piloting the national park system. Across-the-board efforts to conserve resources have seen encouraging progress; the intensity of energy and resource consumption has been significantly reduced.

We convened the Gutian military political work meeting to revive and pass on the proud traditions and fine conduct of our Party and our armed forces, and have seen a strong improvement in the political ecosystem of the people&#39;s forces. Historic breakthroughs have been made in reforming national defense and the armed forces: a new military structure has been established with the Central Military Commission exercising overall leadership, the theater commands responsible for military operations, and the services focusing on developing capabilities. This represents a revolutionary restructuring of the organization and the services of the people&#39;s armed forces. We have strengthened military training and war preparedness, and undertaken major missions related to the protection of maritime rights, countering terrorism, maintaining stability, disaster rescue and relief, international peacekeeping, escort services in the Gulf of Aden, and humanitarian assistance.

We have thus boosted exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and the two regions and maintained prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. We have upheld the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, promoted the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, strengthened cross-Straits economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, and held a historic meeting between the leaders of the two sides.

China champions the development of a community with a shared future for mankind, and has encouraged the evolution of the global governance system. With this we have seen a further rise in China&#39;s international influence, ability to inspire, and power to shape; and China has made great new contributions to global peace and development.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">全面从严治党成效卓著。全面加强党的领导和党的建设，坚决改变管党治党宽松软状况。推动全党尊崇党章，增强政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，坚决维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，严明党的政治纪律和政治规矩，层层落实管党治党政治责任。坚持照镜子、正衣冠、洗洗澡、治治病的要求，开展党的群众路线教育实践活动和“三严三实”专题教育，推进“两学一做”学习教育常态化制度化，全党理想信念更加坚定、党性更加坚强。贯彻新时期好干部标准，选人用人状况和风气明显好转。党的建设制度改革深入推进，党内法规制度体系不断完善。把纪律挺在前面，着力解决人民群众反映最强烈、对党的执政基础威胁最大的突出问题。出台中央八项规定，严厉整治形式主义、官僚主义、享乐主义和奢靡之风，坚决反对特权。巡视利剑作用彰显，实现中央和省级党委巡视全覆盖。坚持反腐败无禁区、全覆盖、零容忍，坚定不移“打虎”、“拍蝇”、“猎狐”，不敢腐的目标初步实现，不能腐的笼子越扎越牢，不想腐的堤坝正在构筑，反腐败斗争压倒性态势已经形成并巩固发展。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">* We have achieved remarkable outcomes in ensuring full and strict governance over the Party.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We have made sweeping efforts to strengthen Party leadership and Party building, and taken strong action to transform lax and weak governance over the Party. We encourage all Party members to hold the Party Constitution in great esteem. We urge them to strengthen their consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment, and to uphold the authority of the Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership.

Disciplinary inspections have cut like a blade through corruption and misconduct; they have covered every Party committee in all departments at the central and provincial levels. No place has been out of bounds, no ground left unturned, and no tolerance shown in the fight against corruption. We have taken firm action to&quot;take out tigers,&quot; &quot;swat flies,&quot; and &quot;hunt down foxes.&quot; The goal of creating a deterrent against corruption has been initially attained; the cage of institutions that prevents corruption has been strengthened; and moral defenses against corruption are in the making. The anti-corruption campaign has built into a crushing tide, and is being consolidated and developed.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">五年来的成就是全方位的、开创性的，五年来的变革是深层次的、根本性的。五年来，我们党以巨大的政治勇气和强烈的责任担当，提出一系列新理念新思想新战略，出台一系列重大方针政策，推出一系列重大举措，推进一系列重大工作，解决了许多长期想解决而没有解决的难题，办成了许多过去想办而没有办成的大事，推动党和国家事业发生历史性变革。这些历史性变革，对党和国家事业发展具有重大而深远的影响。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">The achievements of the past five years have touched every area and broken new ground; the changes in China over the past five years have been profound and fundamental. For five years, our Party has demonstrated tremendous political courage and a powerful sense of mission as it has developed new ideas, new thinking, and new strategies, adopted a raft of major principles and policies, launched a host of major initiatives, and pushed ahead with many major tasks. We have solved many tough problems that were long on the agenda but never resolved, and accomplished many things that were wanted but never got done. With this, we have prompted historic shifts in the cause of the Party and the country. These historic changes will have a powerful and far-reaching effect on the development of this cause.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">五年来，我们勇于面对党面临的重大风险考验和党内存在的突出问题，以顽强意志品质正风肃纪、反腐惩恶，消除了党和国家内部存在的严重隐患，党内政治生活气象更新，党内政治生态明显好转，党的创造力、凝聚力、战斗力显著增强，党的团结统一更加巩固，党群关系明显改善，党在革命性锻造中更加坚强，焕发出新的强大生机活力，为党和国家事业发展提供了坚强政治保证。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">Over the past five years, we have acted with courage to confront major risks and tests facing the Party and to address prominent problems within the Party itself. With firm resolve, we have tightened discipline and improved Party conduct, fought corruption and punished wrongdoing, and removed serious potential dangers in the Party and the country. As a result, both the intraparty political atmosphere and the political ecosystem of the Party have improved markedly. The Party&#39;s ability to innovate, power to unite, and energy to fight have all been significantly strengthened; Party solidarity and unity have been reinforced, and our engagement with the people has been greatly improved. Revolutionary tempering has made our Party stronger and it now radiates with great vitality. With this, efforts to develop the cause of the Party and the country have gained a strong political underpinning.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">同时，必须清醒看到，我们的工作还存在许多不足，也面临不少困难和挑战。主要是：发展不平衡不充分的一些突出问题尚未解决，发展质量和效益还不高，创新能力不够强，实体经济水平有待提高，生态环境保护任重道远；民生领域还有不少短板，脱贫攻坚任务艰巨，城乡区域发展和收入分配差距依然较大，群众在就业、教育、医疗、居住、养老等方面面临不少难题；社会文明水平尚需提高；社会矛盾和问题交织叠加，全面依法治国任务依然繁重，国家治理体系和治理能力有待加强；意识形态领域斗争依然复杂，国家安全面临新情况；一些改革部署和重大政策措施需要进一步落实；党的建设方面还存在不少薄弱环节。这些问题，必须着力加以解决。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">But we must be very clear: There are still many inadequacies in our work and many difficulties and challenges to face.

China&#39;s ability to innovate needs to be stronger, the real economy awaits improvement, and we have a long way to go in protecting the environment.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">In work on public wellbeing there are still many areas where we fall short; and poverty alleviation remains a formidable task.

Social tensions and problems are intertwined, much remains to be done in seeing the country&#39;s governance is based in law, and China&#39;s system and capacity for governance need to be further strengthened. Ideological struggle is still complicated, and in national security we face new developments. Some reform plans and major policies and measures need to be better implemented. Many dimensions of Party building remain weak. These are all problems that demand our full attention to resolve.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">五年来的成就，是党中央坚强领导的结果，更是全党全国各族人民共同奋斗的结果。我代表中共中央，向全国各族人民，向各民主党派、各人民团体和各界爱国人士，向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞和台湾同胞以及广大侨胞，向关心和支持中国现代化建设的各国朋友，表示衷心的感谢！</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">The achievements of the past five years are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, and, more importantly, the result of all Party members and all the Chinese people pulling together in their pursuit.

It means that the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing, blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization.

It will be an era for the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to work together and work hard to create a better life for themselves and ultimately achieve common prosperity for everyone. It will be an era for all of us, the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, to strive with one heart to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. It will be an era that sees China moving closer to center stage and making greater contributions to mankind.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我国社会主要矛盾已经转化为人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾。我国稳定解决了十几亿人的温饱问题，总体上实现小康，不久将全面建成小康社会，人民美好生活需要日益广泛，不仅对物质文化生活提出了更高要求，而且在民主、法治、公平、正义、安全、环境等方面的要求日益增长。同时，我国社会生产力水平总体上显著提高，社会生产能力在很多方面进入世界前列，更加突出的问题是发展不平衡不充分，这已经成为满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要的主要制约因素。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people&#39;s ever-growing needs for a better life. China has seen the basic needs of over a billion people met, has basically made it possible for people to live decent lives, and will soon bring the building of a moderately prosperous society to a successful completion. The needs to be met for the people to live better lives are increasingly broad. Not only have their material and cultural needs grown; their demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, security, and a better environment are increasing. At the same time, China&#39;s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world. The more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate. This has become the main constraining factor in meeting the people&#39;s increasing needs for a better life.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">必须认识到，我国社会主要矛盾的变化是关系全局的历史性变化，对党和国家工作提出了许多新要求。我们要在继续推动发展的基础上，着力解决好发展不平衡不充分问题，大力提升发展质量和效益，更好满足人民在经济、政治、文化、社会、生态等方面日益增长的需要，更好推动人的全面发展、社会全面进步。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society represents a historic shift that affects the whole landscape and that creates many new demands for the work of the Party and the country. Building on continued efforts to sustain development, we must devote great energy to addressing development&#39;s imbalances and inadequacies, and push hard to improve the quality and effect of development. With this, we will be better placed to meet the ever-growing economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological needs of our people, and to promote well-rounded human development and all-round social progress.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">必须认识到，我国社会主要矛盾的变化，没有改变我们对我国社会主义所处历史阶段的判断，我国仍处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段的基本国情没有变，我国是世界最大发展中国家的国际地位没有变。全党要牢牢把握社会主义初级阶段这个基本国情，牢牢立足社会主义初级阶段这个最大实际，牢牢坚持党的基本路线这个党和国家的生命线、人民的幸福线，领导和团结全国各族人民，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，自力更生，艰苦创业，为把我国建设成为富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国而奋斗。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society does not change our assessment of the present stage of socialism in China. The basic dimension of the Chinese context—that our country is still and will long remain in the primary stage of socialism—has not changed. China&#39;s international status as the world&#39;s largest developing country has not changed. The whole Party must be completely clear about this fundamental dimension of our national context, and must base our work on this most important reality—the primary stage of socialism. We must remain fully committed to the Party&#39;s basic line as the source that keeps the Party and the country going and that brings happiness to the people. We must lead and unite the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in fulfilling the central task of economic development. We must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, continue to reform and open up, be self-reliant, hardworking, and enterprising, and strive to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">同志们！中国特色社会主义进入新时代，在中华人民共和国发展史上、中华民族发展史上具有重大意义，在世界社会主义发展史上、人类社会发展史上也具有重大意义。全党要坚定信心、奋发有为，让中国特色社会主义展现出更加强大的生命力！</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Comrades,</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Chinese socialism&#39;s entrance into a new era is, in the history of the development of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the history of the development of the Chinese nation, of tremendous importance.

The New Era: The Historic Mission of the Communist Party of China</strong></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">一百年前，十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。中国先进分子从马克思列宁主义的科学真理中看到了解决中国问题的出路。在近代以后中国社会的剧烈运动中，在中国人民反抗封建统治和外来侵略的激烈斗争中，在马克思列宁主义同中国工人运动的结合过程中，一九二一年中国共产党应运而生。从此，中国人民谋求民族独立、人民解放和国家富强、人民幸福的斗争就有了主心骨，中国人民就从精神上由被动转为主动。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">A hundred years ago, the salvoes of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. In the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism, Chinese progressives saw a solution to China&#39;s problems. With the advent of modern times, Chinese society became embroiled in intense upheavals; this was a time of fierce struggle as the Chinese people resisted feudal rule and foreign aggression. It was in the midst of this, in 1921, as Marxism-Leninism was integrated with the Chinese workers&#39; movement, that the Communist Party of China was born. From that moment on, the Chinese people have had in the Party a backbone for their pursuit of national independence and liberation, of a stronger and more prosperous country, and of their own happiness; and the mindset of the Chinese people has changed, from passivity to taking the initiative.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">中华民族有五千多年的文明历史，创造了灿烂的中华文明，为人类作出了卓越贡献，成为世界上伟大的民族。鸦片战争后，中国陷入内忧外患的黑暗境地，中国人民经历了战乱频仍、山河破碎、民不聊生的深重苦难。为了民族复兴，无数仁人志士不屈不挠、前仆后继，进行了可歌可泣的斗争，进行了各式各样的尝试，但终究未能改变旧中国的社会性质和中国人民的悲惨命运。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">With a history of more than 5,000 years, our nation created a splendid civilization, made remarkable contributions to mankind, and became one of the world&#39;s great nations. But with the Opium War of 1840, China was plunged into the darkness of domestic turmoil and foreign aggression; its people, ravaged by war, saw their homeland torn apart and lived in poverty and despair. With tenacity and heroism, countless dedicated patriots fought, pressed ahead against the odds, and tried every possible means to seek the nation&#39;s salvation. But despite their efforts, they were powerless to change the nature of society in old China and the plight of the Chinese people.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">实现中华民族伟大复兴是近代以来中华民族最伟大的梦想。中国共产党一经成立，就把实现共产主义作为党的最高理想和最终目标，义无反顾肩负起实现中华民族伟大复兴的历史使命，团结带领人民进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，谱写了气吞山河的壮丽史诗。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">National rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people since modern times began.

In pursuing this goal, the Party has united the Chinese people and led them through arduous struggles to epic accomplishments.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">我们党深刻认识到，实现中华民族伟大复兴，必须推翻压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，实现民族独立、人民解放、国家统一、社会稳定。我们党团结带领人民找到了一条以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的正确革命道路，进行了二十八年浴血奋战，完成了新民主主义革命，一九四九年建立了中华人民共和国，实现了中国从几千年封建专制政治向人民民主的伟大飞跃。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">Our Party was deeply aware that, to achieve national rejuvenation, it was critical to topple the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that were oppressing the Chinese people, and realize China&#39;s independence, the people&#39;s liberation, national reunification, and social stability. Our Party united the people and led them in embarking on the right revolutionary path, using rural areas to encircle the cities and seizing state power with military force. We completed the New Democratic Revolution through 28 years of painful struggle, and founded the People&#39;s Republic of China in 1949, thus marking China&#39;s great transition from a millennia-old feudal autocracy to a people&#39;s democracy.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">我们党深刻认识到，实现中华民族伟大复兴，必须建立符合我国实际的先进社会制度。我们党团结带领人民完成社会主义革命，确立社会主义基本制度，推进社会主义建设，完成了中华民族有史以来最为广泛而深刻的社会变革，为当代中国一切发展进步奠定了根本政治前提和制度基础，实现了中华民族由近代不断衰落到根本扭转命运、持续走向繁荣富强的伟大飞跃。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">Our Party was deeply aware that, to achieve national rejuvenation, it was essential to establish an advanced social system that fits China&#39;s reality.

Our whole Party must strengthen our confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must neither retrace our steps to the rigidity and isolation of the past, nor take the wrong turn by changing our nature and abandoning our system. We must maintain our political orientation, do the good solid work that sees our country thrive, and continue to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">伟大斗争，伟大工程，伟大事业，伟大梦想，紧密联系、相互贯通、相互作用，其中起决定性作用的是党的建设新的伟大工程。推进伟大工程，要结合伟大斗争、伟大事业、伟大梦想的实践来进行，确保党在世界形势深刻变化的历史进程中始终走在时代前列，在应对国内外各种风险和考验的历史进程中始终成为全国人民的主心骨，在坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的历史进程中始终成为坚强领导核心。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">This great struggle, great project, great cause, and great dream are closely connected, flow seamlessly into each other, and are mutually reinforcing.

Our answer must be a systematic combination of theory and practice and must address what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop, and how we should go about doing it. This involves fundamental issues like the overarching objectives, tasks, plan, and strategy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era; like the direction, model, and driving force of development, and the strategic steps, external conditions, and political guarantees. As well as this, to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should, based on new practice, undertake theoretical analysis and produce policy guidance on the economy, political affairs, rule of law, science and technology, culture, education, the wellbeing of our people, ethnic and religious affairs, social development, ecological conservation, national security, defense and the armed forces, the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; and national reunification, the united front, foreign affairs, and Party building.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">围绕这个重大时代课题，我们党坚持以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观为指导，坚持解放思想、实事求是、与时俱进、求真务实，坚持辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，紧密结合新的时代条件和实践要求，以全新的视野深化对共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律、人类社会发展规律的认识，进行艰辛理论探索，取得重大理论创新成果，形成了新时代中国特色社会主义思想。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">In answering this question, our Party has been guided by Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development.

In answering this question, our Party has continued to uphold dialectical and historical materialism; has considered carefully the new conditions of the era and the new requirements of practice; and has adopted an entirely new perspective to deepen its understanding of the laws that underlie governance by a Communist party, the development of socialism, and the evolution of human society.

After this, with another 30 years of work, and by the time we celebrate the centenary of the People&#39;s Republic of China, we will have basically achieved modernization and turned China into a modern socialist country.</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">从现在到二○二○年，是全面建成小康社会决胜期。要按照十六大、十七大、十八大提出的全面建成小康社会各项要求，紧扣我国社会主要矛盾变化，统筹推进经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设、生态文明建设，坚定实施科教兴国战略、人才强国战略、创新驱动发展战略、乡村振兴战略、区域协调发展战略、可持续发展战略、军民融合发展战略，突出抓重点、补短板、强弱项，特别是要坚决打好防范化解重大风险、精准脱贫、污染防治的攻坚战，使全面建成小康社会得到人民认可、经得起历史检验。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">The period between now and 2020 will be decisive in finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

Strengthening primary-level Party organizations</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Primary-level Party organizations do the groundwork to ensure the Party&#39;s lines, principles, policies, decisions, and plans are implemented.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will work to ensure that primary-level Party organizations in enterprises, villages, Party and government departments, schools, research institutes, sub-districts, communities, and social organizations play a key role in communicating the Party&#39;s propositions, carrying out the Party&#39;s decisions, overseeing community-level social governance, uniting and mobilizing the people, and promoting reform and development. In doing so, we will focus on improving the organizational capability of primary-level Party organizations and give priority to enhancing their political functions.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Party branches should fulfill their responsibilities for directly guiding, managing, and overseeing their members and for organizing, communicating with, uniting, and serving the people. They should encourage their members to play an exemplary role.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We must practice the system of holding Party branch general meetings, meetings of Party branch committees, Party group meetings, and Party lectures. We will develop new ways for setting up primary-level Party organizations and for them to carry out their activities, strengthen the training of their heads, and expand their reach. We must work harder to address the problems that some primary-level Party organizations are weak, ineffective, and marginalized. We will expand intraparty democracy at the primary level, make Party affairs more transparent, and ensure channels are open for Party members to participate in Party affairs, oversee Party organizations and officials, and submit opinions and suggestions to the Party organization at the next level up.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will do more to recruit new Party members from among industrial workers, young people working in agriculture, well-educated groups, and people working in non-public economic entities and social organizations. We will give more incentives, solicitude, and assistance to Party members. We will make our guidance and management of Party members better targeted and more effective, and handle Party members that don&#39;t meet the mark in a prudent and orderly way.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">（五）持之以恒正风肃纪。我们党来自人民、植根人民、服务人民，一旦脱离群众，就会失去生命力。加强作风建设，必须紧紧围绕保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，增强群众观念和群众感情，不断厚植党执政的群众基础。凡是群众反映强烈的问题都要严肃认真对待，凡是损害群众利益的行为都要坚决纠正。坚持以上率下，巩固拓展落实中央八项规定精神成果，继续整治“四风”问题，坚决反对特权思想和特权现象。重点强化政治纪律和组织纪律，带动廉洁纪律、群众纪律、工作纪律、生活纪律严起来。坚持开展批评和自我批评，坚持惩前毖后、治病救人，运用监督执纪“四种形态”，抓早抓小、防微杜渐。赋予有干部管理权限的党组相应纪律处分权限，强化监督执纪问责。加强纪律教育，强化纪律执行，让党员、干部知敬畏、存戒惧、守底线，习惯在受监督和约束的环境中工作生活。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">5. Working ceaselessly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Our Party comes from the people, has its roots among the people, and is dedicated to serving the people. Once the Party becomes disengaged from the people, it will lose its vitality. In improving Party conduct, we must focus on maintaining the Party&#39;s close bond with the people, keep them firmly in mind, develop a closer affinity with them, and keep working to foster stronger public support for the Party&#39;s governance. We must earnestly address all issues the people are strongly concerned about, and resolutely correct any behavior that undermines the people&#39;s interests.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Our Party officials should lead by example in consolidating and building on the advances made in implementing the central Party leadership&#39;s eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct. We should continue to address the practice of formalities for formalities&#39; sake, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, and oppose mindsets and acts of privilege seeking. We will focus on strengthening the enforcement of political and organizational discipline, and use this to prompt stricter observance of discipline on upholding integrity, on interacting with the people, and regarding work and life.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will continue to carry out criticism and self-criticism in keeping with the principle of learning from mistakes to prevent recurrence and treating the illness to save the patient. We will conduct four forms of oversight over discipline compliance, identify problems early and correct them while they are nascent. Party organizations with the power to supervise officials will be given corresponding power to take disciplinary action as called for, and accountability for overseeing discipline compliance will be tightened up on. We will raise Party members&#39; awareness of discipline and strengthen discipline enforcement, and demand that Party members and officials hold discipline in awe and respect, do not cross the line, and become used to working and living under oversight and constraints.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">（六）夺取反腐败斗争压倒性胜利。人民群众最痛恨腐败现象，腐败是我们党面临的最大威胁。只有以反腐败永远在路上的坚韧和执着，深化标本兼治，保证干部清正、政府清廉、政治清明，才能跳出历史周期率，确保党和国家长治久安。当前，反腐败斗争形势依然严峻复杂，巩固压倒性态势、夺取压倒性胜利的决心必须坚如磐石。要坚持无禁区、全覆盖、零容忍，坚持重遏制、强高压、长震慑，坚持受贿行贿一起查，坚决防止党内形成利益集团。在市县党委建立巡察制度，加大整治群众身边腐败问题力度。不管腐败分子逃到哪里，都要缉拿归案、绳之以法。推进反腐败国家立法，建设覆盖纪检监察系统的检举举报平台。强化不敢腐的震慑，扎牢不能腐的笼子，增强不想腐的自觉，通过不懈努力换来海晏河清、朗朗乾坤。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">6. Securing a sweeping victory in the fight against corruption</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">The people resent corruption most; and corruption is the greatest threat our Party faces. We must have the resolve and tenacity to persevere in the never-ending fight against corruption. Only by intensifying efforts to address both the symptoms and root causes of corruption—by making sure that officials are honest, government is clean, and political affairs are handled with integrity—can we avoid history&#39;s cycle of rise and fall and ensure the long-term stability of the Party and the country.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Currently, the fight against corruption remains grave and complex; we must remain as firm as a rock in our resolve to build on the overwhelming momentum and secure a sweeping victory. We will continue to see that there are no no-go zones, no ground is left unturned, and no tolerance is shown for corruption. We will impose tight constraints, maintain a tough stance and a long-term deterrence, punish both those who take bribes and those who offer them, and prevent interest groups from arising within the Party.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will institute a system of disciplinary inspection for city and county level Party committees in an intensified effort to address corruption that occurs on the people&#39;s doorsteps. Wherever offenders may flee, they will be brought back and brought to justice. We will work for the adoption of national anti-corruption legislation and create a corruption reporting platform that covers both disciplinary inspection commissions and supervision agencies.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will strengthen deterrence so officials don&#39;t dare to, strengthen the cage of institutions so they&#39;re unable to, and strengthen their vigilance so they have no desire to commit acts of corruption. Our political environment will, through tireless efforts, like seas fallen calm and rivers running clear, be clean and free of corruption.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">（七）健全党和国家监督体系。增强党自我净化能力，根本靠强化党的自我监督和群众监督。要加强对权力运行的制约和监督，让人民监督权力，让权力在阳光下运行，把权力关进制度的笼子。强化自上而下的组织监督，改进自下而上的民主监督，发挥同级相互监督作用，加强对党员领导干部的日常管理监督。深化政治巡视，坚持发现问题、形成震慑不动摇，建立巡视巡察上下联动的监督网。深化国家监察体制改革，将试点工作在全国推开，组建国家、省、市、县监察委员会，同党的纪律检查机关合署办公，实现对所有行使公权力的公职人员监察全覆盖。制定国家监察法，依法赋予监察委员会职责权限和调查手段，用留置取代“两规”措施。改革审计管理体制，完善统计体制。构建党统一指挥、全面覆盖、权威高效的监督体系，把党内监督同国家机关监督、民主监督、司法监督、群众监督、舆论监督贯通起来，增强监督合力。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">7. Improving Party and state oversight systems</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">To improve the Party&#39;s ability to purify itself, it is essential that we strengthen Party self-supervision and subject ourselves to public oversight. We must strengthen checks on and oversight over the exercise of power, and ensure that power is exercised under public oversight, in broad daylight, and in an institutional cage. We will strengthen top-down organizational oversight, improve bottom-up democratic oversight, practice peer oversight, and tighten regular supervision over Party members in positions of leadership. We will intensify political inspection to identify problems and ensure that deterrence works; we will establish an oversight network that facilitates coordination in disciplinary inspections conducted at different levels.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will deepen reform of the national supervision system, conduct trials throughout the country, and establish supervisory commissions at the national, provincial, prefectural, and county levels, which work together with the Party&#39;s disciplinary inspection commissions as one office while keeping their own identity. This will ensure that supervision covers everyone working in the public sector who exercises public power. A national supervision law will be formulated. Supervisory commissions will be given responsibilities, powers, and means of investigation in accordance with law. The practice of shuanggui1 will be replaced by detention.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We will reform the auditing management system and improve the statistics system. We will establish an authoritative, efficient oversight system with complete coverage under the Party&#39;s unified command; and integrate intraparty oversight with oversight by state organs, democratic oversight, judicial oversight, public oversight, and oversight through public opinion. All this will create a powerful synergy for conducting oversight.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">（八）全面增强执政本领。领导十三亿多人的社会主义大国，我们党既要政治过硬，也要本领高强。要增强学习本领，在全党营造善于学习、勇于实践的浓厚氛围，建设马克思主义学习型政党，推动建设学习大国。增强政治领导本领，坚持战略思维、创新思维、辩证思维、法治思维、底线思维，科学制定和坚决执行党的路线方针政策，把党总揽全局、协调各方落到实处。增强改革创新本领，保持锐意进取的精神风貌，善于结合实际创造性推动工作，善于运用互联网技术和信息化手段开展工作。增强科学发展本领，善于贯彻新发展理念，不断开创发展新局面。增强依法执政本领，加快形成覆盖党的领导和党的建设各方面的党内法规制度体系，加强和改善对国家政权机关的领导。增强群众工作本领，创新群众工作体制机制和方式方法，推动工会、共青团、妇联等群团组织增强政治性、先进性、群众性，发挥联系群众的桥梁纽带作用，组织动员广大人民群众坚定不移跟党走。增强狠抓落实本领，坚持说实话、谋实事、出实招、求实效，把雷厉风行和久久为功有机结合起来，勇于攻坚克难，以钉钉子精神做实做细做好各项工作。增强驾驭风险本领，健全各方面风险防控机制，善于处理各种复杂矛盾，勇于战胜前进道路上的各种艰难险阻，牢牢把握工作主动权。</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">8.

We will nurture a love of learning in our people.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We should be good at exercising political leadership. We should adopt a strategic perspective, and develop creative thinking and a dialectical approach to thinking; we should think in terms of the rule of law, and think about worst-case scenarios.

We will act more quickly to put in place a system of Party rules and regulations that covers all aspects of Party leadership and Party building, and strengthen and improve Party leadership over bodies of state power.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We should be good at engaging with the people. We will develop new systems, mechanisms, ways, and means for this work. We will urge trade unions, Chinese Communist Youth League organizations, women&#39;s federations, and other people&#39;s organizations to strengthen their political consciousness, become more advanced, and better represent the people; to play their role as bridges linking the Party with the people; and to organize and motivate the people to follow the Party.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We should be good at implementing policy. We should be open and frank, take effective measures to address real issues, and seek good outcomes. We should be ready both to act resolutely and swiftly and to make sustained efforts to tackle tough issues head-on. We should have the perseverance to hammer away until a task is done, and make concrete, meticulous, and effective efforts in all our work.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">We should be good at managing risks. We will improve risk prevention and control mechanisms in all areas, skillfully handle various complex issues, overcome all difficulties and obstacles that we meet on our way, and keep a firm hold on the initiative in our work.</p></p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left">同志们！伟大的事业必须有坚强的党来领导。只要我们党把自身建设好、建设强，确保党始终同人民想在一起、干在一起，就一定能够引领承载着中国人民伟大梦想的航船破浪前进，胜利驶向光辉的彼岸！</p><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; MIN-HEIGHT: 16px" valign="top" align="left"><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">Comrades,</p><p style="MARGIN: 0px 3px 15px">A great cause calls for leadership of a strong party.
